## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for MeoW Token, a cyberpunk-themed cryptocurrency airdrop platform. The application features a gamified experience where users can complete missions, play games, and earn tokens. It's built with React on the frontend, Express.js on the backend, and uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk theme variables
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store

### Blockchain Integration
- **Wallet Support**: Solana wallet adapters (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)
- **Web3 Library**: @solana/web3.js for blockchain interactions
- **External APIs**: CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency price data

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Replit Auth integration for secure user authentication
- OpenID Connect flow with JWT tokens
- Session persistence in PostgreSQL
- Automatic user creation and profile management

### Mission System
- Dynamic mission creation and management
- Category-based missions (daily check-in, social, GitHub, referral, games, pre-sale)
- Point-based reward system
- Progress tracking and completion validation

### Gaming Platform
- Multiple mini-games with point rewards
- Score tracking and leaderboards
- Cyberpunk-themed game experiences
- Integration with mission completion system

### Wallet Integration
- Multi-wallet support for Solana ecosystem
- Secure wallet connection and management
- Transaction handling for pre-sale purchases
- Wallet address verification and storage

### Pre-Sale System
- Token pre-sale with SOL payment support
- Purchase tracking and history
- Automatic token allocation calculation
- Transaction verification system

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate via Replit Auth, creating a session stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Mission Completion**: Users complete missions, triggering point allocation and progress updates
3. **Game Interactions**: Game scores are saved and contribute to overall user points and mission completion
4. **Wallet Operations**: Wallet connections are verified and stored, enabling pre-sale participation
5. **Leaderboard Updates**: User activities update rankings displayed in real-time leaderboards

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL driver for Neon database
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitive components
- **@solana/wallet-adapter-***: Solana wallet integration libraries

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundling for production

### External APIs
- **CoinGecko API**: Real-time cryptocurrency price data
- **Replit Auth**: Authentication and user management service

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite development server for frontend with hot module replacement
- Express server with TypeScript compilation via tsx
- Database migrations managed through Drizzle Kit
- Environment variables for database and authentication configuration

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild compiles TypeScript server code to `dist/index.js`
- Database: Drizzle migrations ensure schema consistency
- Static serving: Express serves built frontend assets in production

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret for session encryption (required)
- `REPL_ID`: Replit environment identifier (required for auth)
- `ISSUER_URL`: OpenID Connect issuer URL (defaults to Replit)
